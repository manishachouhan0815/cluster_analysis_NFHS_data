## Trends in Child Stunting and Contraception Awareness in Women: Analysis of NFHS-4 Data

This project explores two problems: discovering a set of attributes that predicts rate of Stunting, and analysing the influence of Contraception Usage/Awareness on attributes related to health of women and children. The NFHS-4 data has been mined using K-Means Clustering and Association Rule Mining algorithms. The results obtained related to stunting stress the importance of sanitation and health of women (during pregnancy, and overall well-being and education).
